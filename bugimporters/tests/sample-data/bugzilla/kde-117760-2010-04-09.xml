            <thetext>Version:           1.9 (using KDE KDE 3.5.0)

At the moment the &quot;Delete&quot; command behaves differently whether it&apos;s executed from mail in open thread or from parent with closed thread. I case of open thread it deletes only active letter, but in case of closed thread it deletes active letter and all its children. Current &quot;Delete thread&quot; command is found to be confusing as well - it deletes whole thread, not active letter and its children.

The proposal to make it cleaner:
* &quot;Delete thread&quot; deletes always only active letter and all its children.
* &quot;Delete&quot; deletes always only active letter. In case of active letter being parent with closed thread, it (&quot;Delete&quot; command) shouldn&apos;t be available in menu at all.

All this is valid for &quot;Move to Trash&quot; and &quot;Move Thread to Trash&quot; commands as well of course.</thetext>
