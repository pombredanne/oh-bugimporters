Installed from:    openSUSE RPMs

I opened a .txt file in KWord and now I want to save it. If I press Save, &quot;Save As&quot; dialog is opened and the only type I can save the file into is Open Document.

Isn&apos;t there a way to save just a plain text file?</thetext>

            <thetext>Do you mean that KOffice will not be able to OPEN txt files, but user has to open the file in another program and then copy-paste text from that in KOffice?</thetext>

            <thetext>This is about the export filtr; so this has nothing to do with opening text files. This is about getting content out of KWord.</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes, sorry. So user will have to open another application and copy-paste text from KOffice to that application in order to save a plain-text file?</thetext>

            <thetext>You can use kate/kwrite for that for now if your goal is to have it as a file on disk.
For user experience; the not-yet-shipped shape-selector should be able to save the clipboard too. But that one needs to be cleaned up before we can ship it...</thetext>

            <thetext>So why did you close it as FIXED if it&apos;s actually not? Ie. KOffice still does not have this functionality, does it? Wouldn&apos;t WONTFIX be more accurate?</thetext>

            <thetext>The report asks for a way to do this that is no longer the preferred solution and so the spirit of the feature request has been implemented already, but not to the letter of the request.
I think using &apos;fixed&apos; is correct as getting plain text out of a document is possible. I do agree we need more user interface work to make it nicer. Just not in the form that the report asks for and as such the report has out-lived its usefulness to the development team.

I want to thank you for the report and the follow up questions, the road towards a cool KWord is ongoing and I expect that the final result of how you can export content out of KWord will end up being better than what you requested :)</thetext>
